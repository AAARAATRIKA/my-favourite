        Most children these days are addicted to their mobiles or computers-playing games, watching videos, etc. I, however, have taken the advantage of this lockdown to read as many books as I can. But, thatâ€™s not all. I have also started writing my own stories! I wrote my first story in June 2020, and since then, I couldn't stop. I wrote about adventures of two best friends, ups and downs in life and a lot more. Writing books helps me to let my imagination flow out into one page in the form of a story which everyone can enjoy. I like to write about magic, mystery, fantasy, and adventures.
